Voice_of_Hacked_Boy_Soul:

Life is so Mysterious and Sudden surprises; 
Sometimes I fall like a dried leaf and sometimes I raise up like a volcano;
Every time, I decide to do something but I do mostly against it;
oh! My Twenty-Two old Soul wants to flee away wherever it wishes but the chains of Love packs;

Oh! My Dear Soul, Lift up yourself
Come on rise up and show up
Take your staff and Stand up, Do not feel down for what you are, Your will is unComparable
The boy raised again but a girl on the way hacks again;

Oh! Soul do not entertain Love
some most-effective effections traped the boy into a deadly digs;
But Suddenly,Boy wakes-up from his blindness with Pastor teachings
And Escaped from the Deadly dig where full of Poisonous Love Exists;

Life is so Mysterious and Sudden surprises; 
Sometimes i fall like a dried leaf and sometimes i raise up like a volcano;
Boy started to swim alone in the big ocean of Life with no Safegurds
He decided to do wel  again but the penalty come to the picture;

Oh!Soul,Life hacked you again 
Come on soul,walk firmly and do not doubt yourself
Keep faith on the creator,he do things for goodness
but in the end,He will prosper you & Honour You 

wait for the moment,My soul
wait for a while
Let the Sun shine on you again
And Let the JustFul Sun rise on you again;

Amen,Amen,Amen.
